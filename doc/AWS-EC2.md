Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) for running all the applications on Amazon Web Services(AWS) infrastructure. Usually, the corporate customers use the amazon elastic compute cloud(EC2) sevice to run all the applications in a computer environment. By using this tool, the need for upfront hardware investment is eliminated which allows the cutomers to design and deploy all their projects without any delay. Users can launch up to 10 virual servers, configure security and networking, and manage storage using an Amazon EC2.

To connect the EC2 instance with their local system, they need to create a .pem file and using that file via ssh the connection will be established.
